# Stat 139 Section Materials
This repository contains the section handouts and solutions for my 2022 Stat 139 section. Some questions were inspired by the course homeworks, and the data sets were obtained from the cited sources, but the write-ups are my own.

Note: The Kaggle dataset used throughout these problems has [some known issues](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernandol/countries-of-the-world/discussion?resource=download), so any real-world conclusions drawn in these notes should be treated cautiously.
