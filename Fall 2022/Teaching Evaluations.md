## Course assistant comments

- Will went above and beyond for this class, and his section notes were often times the only course component that I could actually
learn from.
- Will was the hero of this class. His office hours always ran 2+ hours over the allotted time so everyone had enough time to get their
questions answered. Beyond helpful and insanely smart ‚Äì‚Äì a master at debugging and explaining concepts without making you
feel stupid. If there was an eval option above Excellent, I'd give him that.
- Genius with a capital G
- Will is probably one of the most on‚Äìthe‚Äìball CAs I have interacted with in sections/office hours...he clearly knows the material
through and through, and can explain it really well to help with our understanding. In short, when I CA this course next fall, I want to
reach this guy's level of CA'ing.
- I absolutely enjoyed having Will be a course assistant for Stat 139. His section became extremely helpful for the second midterm
and completing all of the problem sets. He was also very active on Ed for answering my and others' questions. His comments on
our problem sets were helpful. Could not recommend more.
- Will is an amazing TF: the dedication to helping students is incredible and he is very thorough and clear when explaining tricky
concepts and helping with R code. HIs section was so helpful at providing more example problems.
- Amazing TF! Really knew the material well and helped so much with midterm review and answering questions on Ed.
- Will was a great section leader and his section notes were always very strong and provided lots of really helpful examples for
understanding the most important parts of the material. He provided really helpful feedback on assignments and was very timely in
responding to Ed posts.
- The best teaching fellow I ever had for a course at Harvard by far. Goes above and beyond in helping students and making sure
everyone does well in the course.
- Fantastic, Will is extremely knowledgeable about the material and very happy to answer student questions. One of the most
proactive and committed TF's I've ever interacted with!
- AMAZING! You should become a professor
 -Genius in all aspects. Kind and passionate as well!
- Will is the best TA I have ever seen at this school.
- The üêê. Section notes were a lifesaver
