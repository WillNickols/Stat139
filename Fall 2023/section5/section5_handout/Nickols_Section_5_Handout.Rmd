# Introductions

- One question or thought related to lecture last week (Inference in multiple regression, linear regression through matrices, assumptions)

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, cache=F}
list.of.packages <- c("ggplot2", "gridExtra", "MASS", "reshape2", "dplyr")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]

# Regression on real data

These problems will deal with a dataset of country-level statistics from [UNdata](https://data.un.org/) and [Varieties of Democracy](https://v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/).

```{r, echo=F}
# Read in the data
countries <- read.csv("data/country_stats.csv", check.names = F)
countries_2010 <- countries[countries$Year == 2010,]
```

1. Using this linear model regressing log emissions per capita on log energy per capita and the log of the number of tourists, interpret the results:

```{r, echo=F}
lm1 <- lm(log2(`Emissions per capita (metric tons of carbon dioxide)`) ~ log2(`Supply per capita (gigajoules)`) + 
            log2(`Tourist/visitor arrivals (thousands)`), 
          countries_2010[countries_2010$`Emissions per capita (metric tons of carbon dioxide)` > 0,])

summary(lm1)$coefficients
```

\vspace{3 cm}

2. Check the assumptions of the model.

```{r, echo=F, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=7, fig.align='center', cache=T, warning=F}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm1)
```

\vspace{8 cm}

3. Uganda has tourism and energy usage data but no emissions data. The following are a 90\% confidence interval and a 90\% prediction interval for Uganda's log emissions from this data. Identify which is which, and interpret them.

```{r, echo=F}
round(predict(lm1, newdata=countries_2010[countries_2010$Country=="Uganda",], 
        interval = c("confidence"), level = 0.90), 3)
round(predict(lm1, newdata=countries_2010[countries_2010$Country=="Uganda",], 
        interval = c("prediction"), level = 0.90), 3)
```

\vspace{3 cm}

4. What we actually care about is Uganda's emissions, not its log emissions. We can exponentiate one of the intervals above to get a valid interval on the original scale, but exponentiating the other would not be valid. Which is which and why?

# Coefficient correlation

Recall that our sampling distribution of $\vv{\hat{\beta}}$ is $$\vv{\hat{\beta}}\sim\textrm{MVN}(\vv{\beta}, \sigma^2(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1})$$
We usually estimate the variance-covariance matrix with $\hat{\sigma}^2(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}$, but covariances in the $\hat{\beta}_i$ are hard to interpret. Instead, it would be better to know the correlations.

1. Let $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\sigma^2(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}$. How can we create a correlation matrix from this? You should index into $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ in your answer.

\vspace{5 cm}

2. Three models were fit to predict emissions per capita:
- Only energy supply per capita
- Only tourist/visitor arrivals
- Both energy supply per capita and tourist/visitor arrivals.

A correlation matrix for the coefficients is shown for the last model. Explain the large drop in the tourist/visitor arrivals coefficient from model 2 to model 3. Note that in the original data the energy supply per capita and tourist/visitor arrivals are slightly positively correlated.

```{r, echo=F}
countries <- read.csv("data/country_stats.csv", check.names = F)
countries_2010 <- countries[countries$Year == 2010,]

countries_2010 <- rename(countries_2010, Emissions = `Emissions per capita (metric tons of carbon dioxide)`,
       `Tourists` = `Tourist/visitor arrivals (thousands)`,
       `Energy supply` = `Supply per capita (gigajoules)`,)

lm1 <- lm(log2(`Emissions`) ~ log2(`Energy supply`), 
          countries_2010[countries_2010$`Emissions` > 0,])

summary(lm1)$coefficients

lm2 <- lm(log2(`Emissions`) ~ log2(`Tourists`), 
          countries_2010[countries_2010$`Emissions` > 0,])

summary(lm2)$coefficients

lm3 <- lm(log2(`Emissions`) ~ log2(`Energy supply`) + 
            log2(`Tourists`), 
          countries_2010[countries_2010$`Emissions` > 0,])

summary(lm3)$coefficients

lm3_vcov <- vcov(lm3)
cormat <- t(t(lm3_vcov/sqrt(diag(lm3_vcov))) / sqrt(diag(lm3_vcov)))
round(cormat, 3)
```

3. Consider the following simulation. We will generate data from the model $Y_i=\beta_1X_{i,1}+\beta_2X_{i,2}+\epsilon_i$ with $\epsilon_i\sim\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. (We'll have $\beta_1=\beta_2$, but, of course, the linear model doesn't know this.)

- First, the columns $\vv{X}_1$ and $\vv{X}_2$ will be correlated, and we will fit either a regression just on $\vv{X}_1$ or a regression on both $\vv{X}_1$ and $\vv{X}_2$.
- Second, we will make $\vv{X_1}$ and $\vv{X_2}$ uncorrelated but make $\vv{X_2}$ have a very large variance, and we will again test models with and without $\vv{X_2}$.

We'll record the p-value of the test $H_0:\beta_1=0$ each time.

```{r, echo=F, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align='center', cache=T, warning=F}

}

Explain the p-value trends in the missing-predictor models. Reference the equation for the variance-covariance matrix as necessary.

4. Consider the design matrix $$\mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1\\
    1 & 1\\
    1 & a\\
  \end{bmatrix}$$
  
  What do the rows represent? What do the columns represent? Why should the first column be all $1$s?
  
\vspace{5 cm}

5. Find the variance of $\hat{\beta}_1$ as a function of $a$ and $\sigma^2$.

\vspace{8 cm}

6. What does this say about how the variance of $\hat{\beta}_1$ changes with $a$? Why does this make sense?

# Contrast test and limiting cases

Recall the set-up for a contrast test: $H_0: \vv{C}^T\vv{\beta}=\gamma_0$ vs. $H_a: \vv{C}^T\vv{\beta}\neq\gamma_0$. Under the null, the following random variable has a $t_{n-(p+1)}$ distribution.
$$T=\frac{\vv{C}^T\vv{\hat{\beta}}-\gamma_0}{\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\vv{C}^T(X^TX)^{-1}\vv{C}}}$$

1. Name two situations in which we would take $\gamma_0$ to be 0. What would the contrast vectors be in these cases?

\vspace{4 cm}

2. Perform a formal contrast test based on the energy supply per capita plus tourists/visitors model to determine whether the mean emissions for countries like Seychelles is significantly different from the mean emissions for countries like Madagascar (two East African island countries).

```{r, echo=F}
contrast.test <- function(fit_lm, vec1, vec2) { # Takes named vector but uses the given order
  beta.hat = coef(fit_lm)
  C = vec1 - vec2
  t.stat = C %*% beta.hat/sqrt(t(C) %*% vcov(fit_lm) %*% C)
  p.value = 2*(pt(abs(t.stat),df=fit_lm$df.residual, lower.tail = F))
  return (c("t.stat" = t.stat, "p.value" = p.value, "df" = fit_lm$df.residual))
}

cat("Seychelles:\n")
round(c("(Intercept)" = 1, log2(unlist(countries_2010[countries_2010$Country == "Seychelles", 
                                      c("Energy supply", "Tourists")]))), 3)

cat("Madagascar:\n")
round(c("(Intercept)" = 1, log2(unlist(countries_2010[countries_2010$Country == "Madagascar", 
                                      c("Energy supply", "Tourists")]))), 3)

cat("Test:\n")
contrast.test(lm3, c("(Intercept)" = 1, log2(unlist(countries_2010[countries_2010$Country == "Seychelles", 
                                                         c("Energy supply", "Tourists")]))),
              c("(Intercept)" = 1, log2(unlist(countries_2010[countries_2010$Country == "Madagascar", 
                                                    c("Energy supply", "Tourists")]))))
```

3. Name two cases in which a contrast test should give the same result as another test.

# Linear model variances

Let $\vv{Y}=\mathbf{X}\vv{\beta}+\vv{\epsilon}$ where $\epsilon_i\sim[0,\sigma^2]$ i.i.d. That is, the residuals are centered at 0 and are i.i.d., but they are not Normal. Under some commonly met regularity conditions, [it can be shown](https://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/7110/wiki/clt-regression.html) that
$$\frac{1}{\sigma}(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{1/2}(\vv{\hat{\beta}}-\vv{\beta})\xrightarrow{d}\textrm{MVN}(\vv{0},\mathbf{I_{p+1}})$$

1. Suppose we have a consistent estimator for $\sigma$ (we have some $\hat{\sigma}$ such that $\hat{\sigma}\xrightarrow{p}\sigma$). In the original multivariate Normal convergence statement, we don't know $\sigma^2$, but we still want to say something about convergence. How can we use the consistent estimator instead?

\vspace{4 cm}

2. Find the approximate distribution of $\vv{\hat{\beta}}$ for large $n$.

\vspace{4 cm}

3. This result indicates that one of the linear model assumptions does not matter much with large $n$. Which assumption is this?
