# Stat 139 Section Materials
This repository contains the section handouts and solutions for my 2022 and 2023 Stat 139 sections. Some questions were inspired by the course homeworks, and the data sets were obtained from the cited sources, but all write-ups are my own.

## Changes from 2022 to 2023
Between 50% and 90% of questions overlap between the 2022 and 2023 versions depending on the week, with earlier weeks having the most differences. All coding questions have been replaced in the 2023 version since these proved not very amenable to the format of sections. Finally, in my opinion, the quality of questions and write-ups improved substantially in the 2023 version (especially for early weeks).
