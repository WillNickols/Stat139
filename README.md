# Stat 139 Section Materials
This repository contains Will Nickols's teaching material for the 2022 offering of Stat 139.  Section materials are for 1-hour weekly sections designed to review lecture material and practice concepts that will appear on the homeworks.  Some questions were inspired by the course homeworks, and the data sets were obtained from the cited sources, but the questions, solutions, and write-ups are my own.  I created the midterm review from scratch for the midterm review session I held on October 10<sup>th</sup> as preparation for Midterm 1.  The file `Teaching Evaluations.md` shows Harvard's official anonymized feedback for my teaching collected at the end of the semester.
